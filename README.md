#3D_Portfolio designing
This is a web application built with Three.js, Vite, React.js, and JavaScript. The application is designed to showcase the capabilities of Three.js in creating interactive 3D graphics and animations.

##Getting Started
To get started with the application, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your local machine. Once you have installed these dependencies, you can clone the repository and install the necessary packages by running the following commands in your terminal:
```
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
cd project-name
npm install
```
After the installation is complete, you can start the development server by running:
```
arduino
npm run dev
```
This will launch the application on your local machine at http://localhost:3000.

##Features
The application includes the following features:

Three.js integration for creating interactive 3D graphics and animations
Vite for fast and efficient development and bundling
React.js for building scalable and maintainable user interfaces
JavaScript for creating custom logic and interactions
Usage
The application includes several interactive 3D graphics and animations that can be customized and controlled through the user interface. To use the application, simply interact with the 3D graphics using your mouse or touchpad. You can also adjust the settings and properties of the graphics using the controls in the user interface.
